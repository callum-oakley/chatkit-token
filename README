clone, copy config.example.js to config.js and fill in some details then

  npm install -g .

Now you can generate a token with

  chatkit-token <environment> '{ userId: "alice", su: true }'

Where `<environment>` is one of `production`, `staging`, or `development`.

Second argument is JSON5, all options supported by @pusher/chatkit-server are
supported.

Good for curls

  curl https://us1.pusherplatform.io/services/chatkit/v1/$instance_id/users \
  -X SUBSCRIBE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(chatkit-token development '{ userId: "bob" }')"
